# Helth Insurance Price Prediction
**My Graduations project**

This project utilizes machine learning techniques, including linear
regression and random forest regression, to predict health insurance
costs accurately. Through comprehensive data collection,
preprocessing, and exploratory analysis, influential features are
identified. Robust models are constructed, evaluated using metrics like
MAE and MSE, and fine-tuned for optimal performance. The results
provide actionable insights for healthcare and insurance stakeholders,
empowering them with informed decision-making capabilities.
